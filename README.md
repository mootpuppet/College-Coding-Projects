# Welcome to My College Coding Projects Github Respository

Hello there! I'm a Computer Engineering major at Milwaukee School of Engineering in Milwaukee, WI. This repository is a collection of my coding projects and assignments that I've worked on throughout my academic journey. My experience spans across various programming languages and technologies, including C, Java, Python, ARM, and VHDL.

**Important Note:** This repository is a work in progress. I have three years of work to upload and organize

## About Me

As a dedicated student of computer engineering, I'm passionate about exploring the depths of software development and digital design. When I'm not buried in textbooks or hacking away at code, I cherish spending time with my wife and two kids. Balancing family life with the rigorous demands of my studies is no small feat, but it's a fulfilling adventure.

## Projects

This repository is organized by language and technology:

- **C**: You'll find projects that demonstrate my skills in low-level programming, data structures, algorithms, microcontrollers, and linux.
- **Java**: This section includes object-oriented programming assignments, GUI applications, and more.
- **Python**: Here, I've put together a variety of jupyternotebooks, exploring different machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- **ARM**: Explore my work with ARM assembly language, showcasing my understanding of computer architecture and embedded systems.
- **VHDL**: Dive into my digital design projects using VHDL for FPGA implementations.

## Skills and Interests

- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in C, Java, Python; familiar with ARM assembly and VHDL.
- **Technologies**: Experienced in embedded systems, digital design, and software development.
- **Interests**: Aside from coding, I'm deeply interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the future of autonomous systems.
